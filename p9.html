                This is an invisible map. There are only scales of latitude and longitude on the map. You can click on the map to create blue or green dots and explore whether there is covered by water or land. If you add enough dots on it, it can be a visible map! You
                can adjust the dots’ size by dragging the slider, and also there is “show sample map” to help you compare the invisible map with the real map. Also, the invisible map is a standard map that the scale of latitude and longitude is uniform.
                There are also 2 different map types that can be shown on the canvas too. You can show them and compare the differences of other map projections with the standard map.

                    I spent a lot of time searching for interesting API, and it’s a hard thing. Some are expensive and too complicated to get a key. Some are free, but maybe boring, and not relative to the invisible writing. And I finally choose this one, that is to lets
                    you programmatically determine whether a latitude, longitude coordinate is on water or land. But it is still not perfect — it is not free (but acceptable, $1 for 20000 calls), and has a limitation on the speed (10 calls per second).
                    I originally wanted to make a brush that can draw smoothly on the invisible map, but it will call too many times per second, and there are also delays from I call it to it responses, so I finally decided to make dots, calling once
                    per click. This is the <a href="https://onwater.io/">API link</a> and the usage.

                <p>
                    I used some other elements outside of the canvas, like the slider, button and paragraph to change the parameter and show datas.

                    Every time you click your mouse, the position of your mouse will be recorded and turned to a corresponding latitude and longitude. Then the number will be sent to cal the API. Then the data will be returned and shown on both the map and in words. Also
                    there is a sample map. If you cannot draw a clear image of the invisible map in your mind, you can show the sample map to make it clear.

                <p>
                    It is so hard to find an appropriate API. I tried to look for APIs that are more social-related and can better express the concept of the sousveillance tool, but I failed to do that. Actually most of the datas are “invisible”. They are private, not open
                    to the public, so we can hardly get access to them and learn something from them. So is it a kind of invisible writing? No matter why we cannot access them, maybe for security reasons, or people want to get paid from collecting the
                    data, or they want to hide something bad, there are indeed too much datas invisible, and that makes the world more obscure.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And there are also some problems on making the sample map and invisible map corresponding. Because the distribution of scale is uniform on the invisible map, but there are hardly any maps being like that. So I chose a map that almost have a uniform scale
                    and used PS to adjust it.
                </p>

                    And there are many kinds of map projections. The different ways to project them actually express different ways people use and regard the map. And the Robinson map is known as a ‘compromise’, it shows neither the shape or land mass of countries correct.
                    Arthur Robinson developed it in 1963 using a more visual trial and error development. “I visualised the best-looking shapes and sizes. I worked with the variables, until it got to the point where, if I changed one of them, it didn’t
                    get any better.” It was only at this point that he worked out the mathematical formula. The curved meridians, give it a nice spherical look. This map is such a traditional map. And the Dymaxion Map projection was released by R Buckminster
                    Fuller in 1954 after several decades working on it. The world is projected onto the surface of a icosahedron, allowing it to be unfolded and flattened in two dimensions. It is said to represent the Earth’s continents as “one island”.
                    His desire was to present a projection that had no “right way up” and lose the North up and South down presentation of other world maps. So it is a “decentered” map which shoes a more modern concept. There are many other projections,
                    like the cylindrical world map projection, which regains accuracy in surface area, and orange peel map. The standard map is my own creation, and I think the meaning is to project data easily using uniform scales.
