            <P>
                Nowadays, many people like to add mosaics or stickers to their faces when posting their selfies, partly to protect their privacy and partly because they made a bad face but didn't want to give up the picture. But sometimes mosaics do not reflect the mood
                of the shooting, so I created a selfie camera called “Mask” with emoji stickers, which can track your face for dynamic mosaics, and the appearance of the mask will change according to your expression. There are currently three stickers:
                smile, laugh and angry.
            </P>

            <P>
                And this is an era of privacy and individual rights. When we want to make use of someone's portrait, we have to ask their permission first. So I designed an consentful interface that explained the use and purpose of the camera. The camera will only turn
                on if the user agrees to turn it on.
            </P>

                I used the library called <span class="extraweight">Clmtrackr</span> to track facial features. </p>

                <img src="images/assignment8-1.png" />
            </div>


            <p>
                I set the center point of the emoji at the nose point(62), used the distance between the lips(57& 60) to identify the laughing and smiling expressions, and used the distance between the performers and the eyebrows(17&29) to identify the angry expressions.
                For the rotation of the expression, I used the Angle between the line connected by the eyes(27&32) and the horizontal line to identify it.

            </p>

            <p>
                The camera actually didn't live up to my initial expectations. I originally wanted to use the principle of convolution layer to make a camera that could recognize edges, but the speed of operation was very slow due to too many pixels, high frame rate
                and insufficient performance of the editor. In fact, any dynamic camera effects are impossible to achieve. (Maybe I didn't find the right way). So I chose Clmtrackr, a library that allows dynamic effects to flow smoothly. However, this
                library has a limitation, that is, the accuracy of recognition is not particularly high, so the accuracy of expression is sometimes not very high too.
            </p>
