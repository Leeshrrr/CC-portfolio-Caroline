            <P>
                My game describes my adventure to New York, and the name is “It is my first time to New York”. Because of the limited time, I only made 2 levels — I say good bye to my parents, get all the luggage, and get on the plane; And I successfully arrived New
                York by plane. In the first level, you will control yourself to communicate with your parents and get their response, move and jump to get the luggage, also spending and getting money. After you have all things done, you can get on the
                plane. In the second level, you will control the plane go up and down to escape from the cloud and moving bird flocks.

            </P>

            </p>



            <p>
                <span class="extraweight">1. Concept:</span> I come NY for the first time, and everything is new and interesting for me. Also, I miss my mom snd dad very much when I stay here for some time. So I want to build a game that when people play
                it, they can experience all the adventure with me — also the feelings. My initial goal is to made the whole story, include going to supermarket and get the right thing I want, find my house, take class in English etc, but because of the
                limited time, I only made the scene that I say goodbye to my parents and take the plane to NY.
            </p>


            <p>
                <span class="extraweight">2. Skeletal code:</span> I build different classes and set different conditions to trigger it. There are many challenges, like imitating the gravity, and make the character really “move” when moving. There are
                many other things. Just look at the code.
            </p>



            <p>
                <span class="extraweight">3. Details:</span> Then I add beginning and end scenes, background music and sound when click the button. Also I add a reminder to tell people what to do next and tested different conditions: passed or failed,
                how to restart etc. I add other elements like the money I have (in level one I will get or spend money by communicate with my parents and get the stuff I need, and it may be used in next levels (3or4?))
            </p>

                Build a game is really a hard work. The biggest challenge is to make out the logic of all functions and interactions that need to be achieved. There are different classes, and objects in different classes need to interact. So where should I put the sentences?
                How to decide the conditions? I tried a lot, revise the code for many times to make it work smoothly.
            </p>

            <p>
                And I tried to use different library. I use p5.sound to play background music, and the sound when click the button etc. I also use p5.speech to make the communication with me and my parents. It is a really interesting library, as it can read out the words
                I typed in. I had found a library called p5.play. it is a useful library that can create spites in a game, but I find it a little bit limited to accomplish the goal to build my character, so I finally choose to write the class by my own.
                (Very painful to write everything from underlying logic haha) </p>
